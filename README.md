# Oracle Homelab Scripts

This repository contains scripts for managing Oracle Database environments on a local VM and automating tasks on homelab servers. I am using this repository for my daily tasks.

## Overview
This repository includes:

- **Oracle VM Scripts**: RMAN, PL/SQL, and shell scripts for database backup, recovery, and maintenance. It also includes some basic shell script homeworks I did during my internship.
  
- **Homelab Scripts**: Configuration and automation shell scripts for managing and monitoring home server. It also includes some configuration files for my self-hosted services (Pi-hole, Nextcloud, Portainer etc.)

The repository is designed to streamline database management and server automation processes, serving as a reference for future use and learning.
